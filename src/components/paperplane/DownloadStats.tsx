// This file is an older version and will be deleted.
// The display logic has been moved to DownloadStatsDisplay.tsx
// The container logic (async data fetching) is in DownloadStatsContainer.tsx
// Please ensure this file is removed if it's no longer referenced,
// or update references if it was intended to be kept for another purpose.
// For now, I will empty it to avoid confusion during the build.
// If a file named "DownloadStats.tsx" is still expected by an import,
// this could cause issues. The rename to DownloadStatsDisplay.tsx and
// updates to DownloadStatsContainer.tsx should handle this.

// Intentionally left empty or you can delete it.
// For the purpose of this operation, I'm providing an empty content
// to signify it's being replaced/removed from active use in this context.
// If your build system complains about a missing file because of an old import,
// you might need to delete it manually or ensure all imports are updated.
